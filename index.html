    <p>
        A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing,<br> including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon.<br> The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.<br> The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it,<br> it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.<br> In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.<br> Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass.<br> This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
